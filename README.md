# Goal
`If this README.md is a little lite for you, jump into the cv.rb that creates this file. You may enjoy some of the code or comments.`

      My goal is to secure a short to medium term contract working in either AngularJS, Sinatra / Ruby on Rails.

      I like the Sinatra/NodeJS micro services approach on the backend to build up an API, and AngularJS on the front end to create a compelling UI/UX.

      My preference is for greenfield projects with a Service Orientated Architecture (SOA).

      My preferreed location is either Melbourne, Brighton or Singapore.
